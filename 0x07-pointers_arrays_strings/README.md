# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

### Tasks
#### 0. memset
 function that fills memory with a constant byte.

- Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
- The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
- Returns a pointer to the memory area s
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memset. Run man memset to learn more.
